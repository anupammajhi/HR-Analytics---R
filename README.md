# Problem Statement



A large company named **XYZ**, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of **attrition**(employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons -

1. The former employeesâ€™ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet **timelines**, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners
2. A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of **recruiting** new talent
3. More often than not, the new employees have to be **trained** for the job and/or given time to acclimatise themselves to the company

 

Hence, the management has contracted an **HR analytics** firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.

 

Since you are one of the star analysts at the firm, this project has been given to you.

## Goal of the case study

You are required to model the **probability of attrition** using a logistic regression. The results thus obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.

## Results Expected

1. Write all your code in one well-commented R file; briefly, mention the insights and observations from the analysis 
2. Present the overall approach of the analysis in a presentation 
   - Mention the problem statement and the analysis approach briefly 
   - Explain the results in business terms
   - Include visualisations and summarise the most important results in the presentation

 

You need to submit the following two components:

- **R commented file**: Should include detailed comments and should not contain unnecessary pieces of code 
- **Presentation:**  Make a presentation to present your analysis to the chief data scientist of your company (and thus you should include both technical and business aspects). The presentation should be concise, clear, and to the point. **Submit the presentation after converting it into PDF format.**
